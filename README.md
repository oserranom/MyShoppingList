# My Shopping List
I've decided to continue expanding the list of TO-DO style projects already available on GitHub... BUT in this case, the application works as a shopping list. It's a simple app that will help you remember which products you need to buy when you leave home. The most important aspect of this project has been working with the browser's localStorage API to achieve data persistence in a straightforward way, as well as creating the necessary functionality using JavaScript to add or remove items from the shopping list as needed. This is a project I needed to do because it's great practice for me, even though it's not something particularly groundbreaking...
